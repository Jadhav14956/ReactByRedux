React component life cycle

3. componentWillMount : 
    - called before component mounting, render
    - setting state in this method will not trigger render

2. Constructor : 
    - will be alled before component is mounted.
    - super(this.props) should be called before otherwise props will be undefind
    - constructor is the right place to initialize state. 
    - you can use props to initialise state.

1. Render : 
    - return DOM/Custome element to render this component   
    - return NULL / false to tell react you dont want this react component to render
    - this function should be pure function. 
        * should not modify component state
        * should return same result every time.
        * should not directly interact with browser(Do browser intyeraction in componentDidMount
        * 
    - render() will not be called if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.

4. componentDidMount :
    - called after component is mounted
    - this triggers render
    - hence good place to get data from server endpoints

5. componentWillReceiveProps : 
    - NOTE : calling this.setState generally doesn't trigger componentWillReceiveProps.
    - it is called only when props have been updated, not when they are initialised.
    -  React may call this method even if the props have not changed, This may occur when the parent component causes your component to re-render.

6. shouldComponentUpdate : 
    - This method is not called for the initial render or when forceUpdate() is used.
    - Returning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.
    - default behaviour is to tell react that it can render this component with new changes.

7. componentWillUpdate : 
    - invoked immediately before rendering when new props or state are being received.
    - Use this as an opportunity to perform preparation before an update occurs. 
    - This method is not called for the initial render.
    - Note that you cannot call this.setState().
    - will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.

8. componentDidUpdate : 
    - invoked immediately after updating occurs. 
    - This method is not called for the initial render.
    - a good place to do network requests.
    -  will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.

 ******************************************************************************
 setState : 
    - this will render compoennt again unless, shouldComponentMount returns false.
    - Request : a request rather than an immediate command to update the component.
    - Batch Processing of updates : For better perceived performance, React may delay it, and then update several components in a single pass. React does not guarantee that the state changes are applied immediately.
    - CallBack : use callback for setState, which this ensure state is updated by react.
